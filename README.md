# 🛡️ PhishDetect – Phishing Email & URL Detection System

PhishDetect is an intelligent web-based phishing detection tool that uses a hybrid approach of rule-based heuristics, machine learning models, and VirusTotal API integration. It allows users to scan suspicious **URLs** and **email bodies**, get instant classification (Safe / Suspicious / Malicious), and view scan history – all wrapped in a secure login-protected interface using **AWS Cognito**.
